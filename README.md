This brings together GIS teaching materials from a variety of weeks and incarnations
into a single set of open source frameworks that are easy to manage in a git repository.

## Lectures

The lecture slides use the [`reveal-md`](https://github.com/webpro/reveal-md) framework:
the slide contents are maintained in simple markdown files using a per-lecture image
directory for media. The `reveal-md` framework allows these to be served as HTML slides.

In the `lectures` base directory, there are three shared files:

- `reveal.json`: This is used to set options to the `reveal-js` backend.
- `reveal-md.json`: This is used to set options to `reveal-md` itself. It isn't always
  obvious where the division lies!
- `lectures.css`: This file is used as a common set of styling changes for the lectures.

Both `json` configuration files are automatically loaded when `reveal-md` is run in the
base directory, but the `css` file needs to be explicitly loaded. So, to view one of the
lectures in a browser, you need to do the following:

```bash
cd lectures
reveal-md lecture_1/lecture_1.md --css lectures.css --watch
```

The `--watch` option makes `reveal-md` reload the presentation when the source file is
changed, which is useful when writing the presentation.

There is also an `index.md` file that contains a single slide with links to each
lecture:

```bash
cd lectures
reveal-md index.md --css lectures.css
```

### R markdown

Some of the slides use R markdown to generate figures and examples. This adds a step to
the process as the `.rmd` file needs to be run through `knitr` before it can be viewed
in `reveal-md`. For example:

```bash
Rscript -e "knitr::knit('lecture_5.rmd')"
```

### Layout

Markdown is not about layout, so the framework uses HTML and CSS to position elements on
the slide. These are setup as HTML tags within the Markdown text and are fairly minimal:
vertical columns are created by wrapping columns in `<div class='container'>`. Each
column inside that then uses a `<div class='col'>` to wrap the content of the column.
There are a few options defined in `lectures.css` to set the relative widths of columns
and set text alignment and padding for text columns.

It is also possible to supply styles for individual slide elements using HTML comments
to add CSS styling.

### Exporting lectures

The `reveal-md` framework makes it very simple to export HTML lectures as PDF files.

```bash
reveal-md lecture_1/lecture_1.md --css lectures.css --print slides/lecture_1.pdf
```

You can also create a static HTML page:

```bash
reveal-md lecture_1/lecture_1.md --css lectures.css --static lecture_1/static
```

### Build script

The script `lectures/build_slides.sh` automatically builds slides from all lectures in
the lectures directory. Note that you can't be watching a lecture using `reveal-md`
while doing this as the script currently tries to set the server going on the same port.

## Practicals

The practical files are built using JupyterBook. The files themselves are stored as
Markdown files using the Myst Markdown extensions provided for JupyterBook. This makes
it easy to save the notebooks in the more human readable Markdown format.

There are two stages to deploying the pages:

1. Build the site, generating the `practicals/_build` folder containing the `html`
   folder

```bash
jupyter-book build practicals/
```

1. Publish the html version of the pages to Github

```bash
ghp-import -n -p -f practicals/_build/html
```

That currently seems to stall for some reason, so it is basically the same as:

```

    "# Introduction to the practicals\n",
    "\n",
    "These practicals introduce a core set of GIS concepts and functions in R and then\n",
    "explore some more common use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these practicals are **self-paced**: you can work through them at your own speed\n",
    "and call out when you need help.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Three before 'me'\n",
    "\n",
    "There will be a team of demonstrators to help you when you get stuck but please do\n",
    "remember that helping yourself is actually a far better way to learn. We do *not* want\n",
    "you to struggle but before you reach out to a demonstrator:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ask *yourself* what you are trying to do: often stepping back and trying to write out\n",
    "   an explanation for your problem helps you solve it.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ask the *internet*: Sites like [stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com) are an\n",
    "   invaluable resource and you can use *tags* on `stackoverflow` (e.g. `[R]` or `[sf]`)\n",
    "   to narrow down your search.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ask *each other*: it can be really helpful to get together in a short Team meeting\n",
    "   and crowd source an answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "If none of those work then ask us!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting started\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each practical has its own RStudio Cloud Project. This will contain all of the data\n",
    "  needed for the practical and will have the required packages pre-installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If you are working on your own computer, you will need to install those packages and\n",
    "  the data required in the practical. There are quite a lot of required packages - they\n",
    "  could take a little while to set up. See [here](required_packages.md) for details of\n",
    "  the packages and data you will need.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Once you have your project launched or a local working directory set up and are\n",
    "  running in R then **create a new script file to record and run your code**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Work through the handouts at your own pace.\n",
    "\n",
    "## GIS packages\n",
    "\n",
    "There are loads of R packages that can load, manipulate and plot GIS data and we will be\n",
    "using several in these practical. In the last few years, the R spatial data community\n",
    "has been working on updating most of the core GIS functionality into a few core\n",
    "packages, notably `sf` and `terra`. We will focus on using these up-to-date central\n",
    "packages, but there will be some occasions where we need to use older packages, such as\n",
    "`sp` and `raster`.\n",
    "\n",

    "A lot of these practicals will consist of following provided code to understand how it\n",
    "works but occasionally there will be **tasks** to test the skills you have been\n",
    "learning. These will start with a task bar like the one above and then have a\n",
    "description like this one. There will then always be a button marked 'Click to show': if\n",
    "you get really stuck, you can click on this to show a solution. Do try and figure it out\n",
    "for yourself and if you don't understand something, ask a demonstrator to help.\n",
